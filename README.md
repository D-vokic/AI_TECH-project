Front-end developer and high school teacher.

A Few Interesting Facts at the beginning.

I'm Coming From Serbia.

I'm a graduate from the Faculty of Theology and University of Hospitality.

I am not interested in goals if they are not for the benefit of people.

I will be happy to help anyone at any time.

These are my first projects available on GitHub.

I hope not the last.

I’m currently learning JavaScript.

This is project done in HTML, CSS/SASS And JavaScript.

The tenth project in a row where I started using the new rule @use instead of the old @import rule.
